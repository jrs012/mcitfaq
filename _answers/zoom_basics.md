# Zoom â€“ video conferencing

## Get started on your own
Go to [mariettacollege.zoom.us](https://mariettacollege.zoom.us/) and sign in SSO. You might want to invite a colleague to a meeting and have a practice session, trying out various features. Decide on a day and time, open a Zoom meeting, and click the  **Invite**  button to invite anyone with a Marietta College Zoom account to join you in your meeting.
## Join a meeting
Copy and paste the link from the zoom you were invited to the web search engine. Or sign in to zoom and use the meeting ID. Or by phone call using one of the numbers attached to that meeting.
## Use Zoom for classroom or meeting space
 Zoom supports teaching and learning activities that you and your students do at the same time. You can use Zoom to schedule and hold class sessions and office hours. Each class session (meeting, in Zoom terminology) gets a link, which you share with your students. At the time/day of the class session, students click the link to join you in Zoom. You can record class sessions and save them to the cloud for students to review.
## Sign in
Go to [mariettacollege.zoom.us](https://mariettacollege.zoom.us/) and sign in bottom middle with SSO. (also covered above)
## Invite people to a scheduled meeting
You invite someone to an already scheduled meeting by going to the meeting and clicking the invite arrow right beside participants.
## Share your screen
When you are in a meeting, find the green ** Share ** button on the bottom of the Zoom screen, then click it. A window will open showing several options for sharing. By default, your desktop will be selected. Choose what you want to share. At the bottom of the window, click ** Share**.
